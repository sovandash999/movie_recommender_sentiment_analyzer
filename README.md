# movies_recommender_with_sentiment_analysis

1. This is an content based moivies recommender app which calculates the similarty of movies based on cosine similarity.

2. I have leveraged the methods of web scrapping to fetch the top 100 reviews of any selected movie and used NLTK library for sentiment analysis. 



# Running the app


1.download the jupyter file and run to extract a few model in the form of .pkl,the pkl files contain the movies similarity matrix.

2. load the project onto any editor and install the requirements using requiremnets.txt file

3. run the app using 'streamlit run APP.py' command

4. play around.

# launch app directly: https://movierecommendersentimentanalyzer.streamlit.app
(clicl on a movie's analyze button first to load a movie to session state,going to analyze page directly throws an error)
